# Citi-Bikes-Analysis

Given responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States, I was expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so the task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

# Files

# Data

* For the analysis and visualizations, I collected June to December 2013, and January and February 2014 data from  https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data.

* In  cleaned.merged.dataset.ipynb, I cleaned and combined all the CSV files to citibike_tripdata.csv. The single csv file was then added to Tableau and visualizations were created to explore different phenomena.
